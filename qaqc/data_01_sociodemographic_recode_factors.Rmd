# Load packages

```{r, message= FALSE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(readr)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
```

# Load data

Load the data tables into the global environment as data frames.We will create factor variables for all categorical variables in the data frames and save them to a new CSV file. 

```{r load data, messages = FALSE}
socdem <- read_csv("../data/raw/Sociodemographic Information.csv") # 600 31
```

# Data cleaning

Here we will convert all variable names to snake case so that everything is uniform.

```{r}
# Convert all variable names to snake case
walk(
  # Grab the names of all data frames in the global environment
  .x = ls()[map_lgl(ls(), ~ is.data.frame(get(.)))],
  .f = function(x) {
    # Grab individual df from environment
    df <- get(x)
    # Grab the variables names
    var_names <- names(df)
    # Convert variable names to snake case
    var_names <- str_replace_all(var_names, '(\\B)([A-Z])', '_\\2')
    # Convert variable names to lower case
    var_names <- str_to_lower(var_names)
    # Fix medstar_id
    var_names[var_names == "medstar_i_d"] <- "medstar_id"
    # assign back to the dataframe
    names(df) <- var_names
    # Replace df with new names in global environment
    assign(x, df, envir = .GlobalEnv)
  }
)
```

Replace "<92>" and "\x92" with an apostrophe so that values read "Don't know".

```{r}
socdem <- socdem %>% 
  mutate(
    across(
      everything(),
      function(x) {
        x <- str_replace(x, "<92>", "'")
        x <- str_replace(x, "\x92", "'")
        x
      }
    )
  )
```

Participants were allowed to choose more than one race during the interview. Since some people chose more than one race, a dummy variable was created.
